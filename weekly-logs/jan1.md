This week I've been trying to assemble more conrete ideas about the core of my project.
While I was initally very excited about the area I'm working on I have now realized how hard it is to
dig down into specifics and try to frame the main question for my future research. Reflecting on that,
I will learn not to take the process of idea generation for granted and try and learn skills, processes
or even tools for such situations. Just because my course has the word "creative" in the name doesn't
mean I get to have ideas for free. Here is some of the stuff I've been doing this week:

I am worried my inital intution of what I want to do would only present me with superficial problems.
I want to avoid spending 3 months of work on a problem noone has. An example would be the following path
I could take: given current user behavour (mouse, keyboard) + active window, what is user doing?
Reading/programming/procrastinating? Is it a good time to disturb him (call, notifications etc).
What metadata can we get from this (time of concentration bursts, work patterns etc). Would machine learning
even be useful in this context?    

In conclusion, it's been a stressful week, as I feel like I just want to start working/reading/studying.
It might be a useful experience to be outside my comfort zone and learning how to deal with these situations
but I'm worried about losing time. At this point it might better for me to be told by my supervisor what
problem I should start working on (which will probably be the topic of our next meeting).
