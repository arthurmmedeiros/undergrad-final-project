## February, week 2

This week I created a mini web app using the device motion example code and integrating it in a React + D3 template.
It was somewhat grunt work but will provide for a coherent architecture for future features. The current version has two tabs available - one for the graphs and one for recording gesture or sending continuous data. You have three buttons: Record gesture, Send gesture data and send continuous data. You can use the first one in multiple takes to create a complex gesture and then send the data using the second one. If you want to send continuous you can use the third one. A gesture is created using motion data while the third button is sending orientation data.
