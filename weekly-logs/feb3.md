## February, week 4

I worked on a few fronts this week. On one hand, I worked on the user interface, adding just enough to fulfill my target of one working input and one output. I had loosely architectured my app into two such components. I chose my first output to be just a set of words (classes) - the "hello world" of my application so to speak. Additionally, I looked into some machine learning Javascript libraries to see what I can reuse to replace Wekinator. Finally, I had to spend some time reading up on how to deal with state in my React app. Specifically, I needed to figure out how my interdependent components could communicate with each other, since the Record component was receiving data through web sockets which it had to send over to the Model component, while also knowing which class is being currently trained! I chose to use the popular React library Redux as it offered a simple and functional way to deal with the app's state.
