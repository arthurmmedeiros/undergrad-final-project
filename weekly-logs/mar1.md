## March, week 1

This week is a continuation of last week's effort to finish the first testable version of my app.
I succeeded to hook up all of my app's components together so data is flowing between them when I need it to.
I also introduced the React Bootstrap library in my code which will help me with the layout and styling of the app which is something I want to worry as little as possible during my project. Unfortunately, the last missing piece to get working before I can start testing was the K-nearest neighbour library behaving as Wekinator does. On Thursday that did not happen so this is my current top priority.
